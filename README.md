<p>The main point behind creating this github account is to upload future projects completed in school as well as the workforce. The repository created is a standard repository containing future projects. The process also contained cloning the repository via the desktop version by pulling the file from the documents folder on the desktop.</p>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on completing a degree in cybersecurity. This assignment entails writing a summary of our upcoming goals when using github.
